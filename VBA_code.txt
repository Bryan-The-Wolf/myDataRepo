1st I have no idea what I'm doing

Sub Ticker_loop()
    
    Dim Ticker As String
    
    'For Each ws In Worksheets
    For i = 2 To LastRow
        
        LastRow = ws.Cells(Rows.Count, 1).End(xlUp).Row
        
        Ticker = Cells(i, 1).String
        
        Cells(i, 9).String = " "
                
    Next i
    
    
End Sub

Sub Ticker()

    Dim Ticker As String
    For i = 2 To 20
    
    Ticker = Cells(i, 1)
    
    Cells(i, 9) = Ticker
               
        
    Next i
    
End Sub

*****5th Breakthrough, works only on the first worksheet*****

Sub Ticker()
    
    'For Each ws In Worksheets

    Next i
    
End Sub

*****6th Loop works for all of the worksheets *****

    For Each ws In Worksheets
    
        Dim Ticker As String

        If Ticker = 0 Then GoTo NextIteration <--From StackOverflow
